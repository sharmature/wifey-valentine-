# Valentine's Surprise Website 💕

A day-by-day gamified Valentine's surprise website!

## Quick Start

1. **Add your photo** (IMPORTANT!):
   - Place a photo of you two in `public/our-photo.jpg`
   - Make it square (800x800px or larger works best)
   - The puzzle will use this photo automatically

2. **Run the dev server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Access the site**:
   - **Demo Mode (for testing)**: Add `?demo=true` to the URL
     - Example: `http://localhost:5173/?demo=true`
     - This lets you test ALL days with a day selector
   - **Real Mode (for her)**: Just the normal URL
     - Example: `http://localhost:5173/`
     - Shows only today's day, locks future days with countdown

## Rose Day Features

- 🧩 **Photo Puzzle Game**: 3x3 sliding puzzle with your photo
- ⏱️ **Timer & Move Counter**: Track her progress
- 💕 **Surprise Message**: Beautiful message revealed when puzzle is solved
- 📱 **Mobile Friendly**: Works on all devices

## Days

- ✅ **Rose Day (Feb 7)** - Photo puzzle game (READY!)
- Coming soon: Other days will be added one by one!

## Demo Mode vs Real Mode

### 🎭 Demo Mode (`?demo=true`)
- **For you**: Test all days right now
- Shows admin interface with day selector
- Perfect for previewing and testing

### 💕 Real Mode (normal URL)
- **For her**: Only shows current day
- Future days are locked with beautiful countdown
- She must wait for the actual date - no cheating! 🔒

## Deployment

See `DEPLOY.md` for deployment instructions to Vercel or other platforms.

## Next Steps

After Rose Day, we'll add:
- Propose Day (Feb 8)
- Chocolate Day (Feb 9)
- And more... one day at a time!
